# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a **maker education project repository** (雞本創客) focused on chicken coop reconstruction as a hands-on learning experience. The repository contains educational materials and course planning documents for project-based learning.

## Project Structure

### Course Planning System
- **Daily folders**: Named with format `YYYY-MM-DD-課程主題` (e.g., `2025-09-01-雞舍重建計畫`)
- **plan.txt**: Master course plan with detailed curriculum design
- **Course materials**: Each daily folder contains specific lesson materials and forms

### Document Types and Templates

The repository uses a systematic approach to educational document creation:

#### Planning Documents
- **時間流程控制表**: Detailed lesson timing and flow control
- **學生分組表**: Student team assignments and role definitions
- **工具清點檢核表**: Safety and tool management checklists

#### Learning Materials
- **使用者需求訪談學習單**: User research worksheets (observing chickens as "users")
- **成果展示評量表**: Assessment rubrics for project outcomes

### Language and Cultural Context
- Primary language: **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)**
- Educational approach: Project-based maker education
- Target audience: Students engaged in hands-on construction projects

## Working with This Repository

### Document Creation Workflow
1. Read and analyze `plan.txt` for course requirements
2. Create date-specific folder with format `YYYY-MM-DD-課程主題`
3. Generate required educational materials based on lesson plan
4. Use consistent markdown formatting with tables for structured data

### Content Standards
- All educational materials should be practical and ready-to-print
- Include safety considerations and checklists
- Design for collaborative learning (team-based activities)
- Integrate maker education principles (observation, design, build, reflect)

### File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive Chinese names for educational materials
- Maintain consistency with existing document types
- Include completion checkboxes and fill-in sections for interactive use

## Educational Philosophy

This repository supports a **project-based maker education approach** where students:
- Learn through authentic problem-solving (reconstructing chicken coops)
- Work in collaborative teams with defined roles
- Practice design thinking by observing "users" (chickens)
- Integrate practical skills with academic learning
- Document their learning process through structured worksheets

When creating or modifying educational materials, maintain focus on hands-on learning, safety, and student engagement through real-world projects.
